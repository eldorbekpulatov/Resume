Hi my name Eldor and I am a junior. I study Electrical and Computer Engineering, also minoring in Business. I guess I will tell you about my interests. I have been primarily involved in software development. I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence. Over the summer I had the opportunity to learn more about it. I was interning at a startup that primarily focused on image processing. During my time there I realized that Machine learning has a great potential and now more than ever is the best time to get into the field. So here we are. You can read about it in my resume. I am also part of a student lead project team called AguaClara, which is one of the largest on campus by count (80+). 
I serve as a Research Advisor for its Apps&Algorithms team. Our goal is to open source our research and put it on a platform that's accessible by most. My job is to basically manage over 30 students and delegate tasks among sub-teams and be a technical resource for any issues. Although I don't have the strongest background in my own major, I have a lot of 
transferrable skills. I believe my acquired skills will help me adapt into any field choice. As a Summary, JUST HIRE ME.
